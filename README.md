- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KatWicPa
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Monte Carlo simulations. For five years I've been studying nanotechnology, but after that I choose diffrent path. <br>
      Right now I'm a PhD student on Politechnika GdaÅ„ska, trying to figure out how coding works.  
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, Bash and Python.
